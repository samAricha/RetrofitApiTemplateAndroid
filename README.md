# Retrofit Exploration in Android

This project is an in-depth exploration of Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. As we progress through the project, we will also integrate other elements like securing APIs with the Android NDK and image handling with Coil, all while developing a modern UI with Jetpack Compose.

## Overview

The project follows a step-by-step approach, with each step handled as a separate branch for easy reference.

## Steps

1. **Step 1 - Basic Retrofit Setup:** (`step1-basic-retrofit-setup` branch)
    - Setting up Retrofit for making API calls.
    - Making a basic GET request to fetch data from an API.

2. **Step 2 - Securing API Key:** (`step2-securing-api-key` branch)
    - Introduction to the Android NDK.
    - Storing the API key securely with NDK.

And so on...

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/samAricha/RetrofitApiTemplateAndroid.git


## Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or later
- JDK 8 or later
- An Android device or emulator running API 21 (Android 5.0) or later

## Key Aspects

- **Retrofit:** Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- **Securing APIs:** Using Android NDK to secure API keys.
- **Coil:** Efficient image loading and caching.
- **Jetpack Compose:** Developing UI with Android's modern, declarative toolkit.

## Libraries Used

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/)
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the Retrofit service interfaces and data model classes for network calls.
- `keys/` - Contains files related to API keys and other secured information.
- `ui/` - Contains all the UI files, developed using Jetpack Compose.

## Running the Project
